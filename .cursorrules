# Cursor Rules

## Constitution Directory

**IMPORTANT**: Always read and follow the instructions in the `constitution` directory before making changes or implementing features.

The `constitution` directory contains project-specific guidelines, requirements, and instructions that must be followed. These instructions take precedence over general coding practices when they conflict.

### How to Use Constitution Files

1. **Before starting any task**: Read all relevant files in the `constitution` directory
2. **When implementing features**: Check if there are specific requirements or patterns documented in the constitution
3. **When making decisions**: Prioritize the guidelines in the constitution directory over general best practices
4. **If instructions conflict**: Follow the constitution directory instructions

### Constitution Files Location

- Root level: `/constitution/` - Contains project-wide guidelines
- Package level: `/toolbox/constitution/` - Contains package-specific guidelines

Always check both locations for relevant instructions before proceeding with any task.
